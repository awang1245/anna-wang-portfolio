              In this project, I designed and developed a website for my
              imagined coffee brand, Kopi Organic Roastery. The goal was to
              create an interactive list-based interface where users are able to
              select and aggregate items. Users can browse, filter, and sort
              through Kopi's signature coffee offerings and add them to their
              carts.
            </p>
            <p>
              My process involved first conducting a competitive analysis on
              three competing food and beverage platforms, building out the Kopi
              brand, and then sketching, prototyping, and developing an online
              platform for purchasing its products.
